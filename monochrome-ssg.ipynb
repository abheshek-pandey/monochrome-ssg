    "\n",
    "A custom-built `Python` Static Site-Generator used to generate pages for my personal [website](https://www.abhe.in/) and [blog](https://www.abhe.in/blog/).\n",

    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "The script as it is, is used to fulfill the \"back-end\" needs of my website hosted here on GutHub Pages. However, it can easily be modified for use in different scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following instructions are meant for Windows. Commands may vary for terminals other than `Powershell`.\n"
