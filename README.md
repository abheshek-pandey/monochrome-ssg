# Monochrome-SSG

## About

A custom-built `Python` Static Site-Generator(SSG) used to generate pages for my personal [website](https://www.abhe.in/) and [blog](https://www.abhe.in/blog/). It's used to fulfill the "back-end" needs of my website hosted here on GutHub Pages.

Called "Monochrome" because it was for being built for a website that was rendered using mostly black and white, and a hint of grey. However, before I could finish this script, I added a dark-mode that's got a lovely shade of [pink](https://www.color-hex.com/color/e62492) as the highlight colour.

The name stuck to the argument that the pink is the only "chrome" in the surrounding greyscale. Though it was mostly because I could not think of anything else.

The code was inspired by [Jahongir Rahmonov's](https://rahmonov.me/posts/static-site-generator/) tutorial.
